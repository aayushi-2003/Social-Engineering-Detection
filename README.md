# Exploring the impact of AI on Social Engineering attacks
AI for Cybersecurity Project

Solutions implemented to detect and mitigate social enginereeing attacks:
1) Phishing URL Detection
2) Phishing Text Classification Model

I have mainly worked on the Phishing URL Detection, conducting feature extraction and training the model. 

We have obtained a model that predicts Phishing URLs with Precision = 96.85%, Recall = 96.11%, Accuracy = 96.52% and F1 Score = 96.48%.
